The paper can be download from researchgate(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348539447_Flexible_worker_allocation_in_aircraft_final_assembly_line_using_multi-objective_evolutionary_algorithms)

# code
I writed the NSGA-IV code on the basis of java and MoeaFramework. The latest release can be downloaded from the releases page. 

You should add Maven dependency to pom.xml file firstly:

\<dependency>

>>\<groupId>org.moeaframework\</groupId>
    
>>\<artifactId>moeaframework\</artifactId>
    
>>\<version>2.13\</version>
    
\</dependency>
